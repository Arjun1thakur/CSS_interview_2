        <h1>Q1. What is box sizing?</h1>
        <h3>The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.</h3>
        <h3>By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:</h3>
        <h3>width + padding + border = actual width of an element   <br>
            height + padding + border = actual height of an element</h3>
        <h3>This means: When you set the width/height of an element, the element often appears bigger than you have set (because the element's border and padding are added to the element's specified width/height).</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h1>Q2. What is animation delay?</h1>
        <h3>The animation-delay CSS property specifies the amount of time to wait from applying the animation to an element before beginning to perform the animation. The animation can start later, immediately from its beginning, or immediately and partway through the animation.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h1>Q3. Which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid?</h1>
        <h3>The grid-row property specifies a grid item's size and location in a grid layout, and is a shorthand property for the following properties::
            <br><b>grid-row-start</b><br>
            <b>grid-row-end</b></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h1>Q4. Which property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid?</h1>
        <h3>The grid-column property specifies a grid item's size and location in a grid layout, and is a shorthand property for the following properties:
            <br><b>grid-column-start</b><br>
            <b>grid-column-end</b></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h1>Q5. what is the difference between display none and visibility hidden?</h1>
        <h3>
            <b>display: none;</b><br>
            The display: none property is used to hide elements without deleting them. It does not take up any space.   <br>
            <br> In this case, the tag is removed from the page, which allows other elements to fill in.
            <br><br>    <b>visibility: hidden;</b><br>
            The visibility: hidden property also hides an element, but affects the layout i.e., it takes up the space.
            <br><br>
            The element is hidden from view but not the page flow.
